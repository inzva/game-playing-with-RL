inzva AI Projects #2 - Game Playing with Reinforcement Learning Project

## Project-Description

This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 


## Project-Aim

We aim to learn RL algorithms and try to implement that to the RL games.

###  Descreate Space
1- Cartpole-v0 with VPG                                                                                                  
2- Pong: The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over.                                         
3- The Taxi: In this lab, you will train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers. 

### Continuous Space
1- MountainCarContinuous-v0 with Actor Critic/PPO                                                                               
2- BipedalWalker-v2 with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)/ Genetic Algorithms.                                        

## RL Algorithms
==> Cross-Entropy Method

The cross-entropy (CE) method is a Monte Carlo method for importance sampling and optimization. It is applicable to both combinatorialand continuous problems, with either a static or noisy objective. The method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases:

1--Draw a sample from a probability distribution.

2--Minimize the cross-entropy between this distribution and a target distribution to produce a better sample in the next iteration.
