inzva AI Projects #2 - Game Playing with Reinforcement Learning Project

# Project-Description

This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 


# Project-Aim

We aim to learn RL algorithms and try to implement that to the RL games.

# Descreate Space
Cartpole-v0 with VPG
Pong : The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over. 
The Taxi: In this lab, you will train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers.

# Continuous Space
MountainCarContinuous-v0 with Actor Critic/PPO
BipedalWalker-v2 with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)/ Genetic Algorithms.
